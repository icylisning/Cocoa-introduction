The Final Presentation of the Course: Library Information Systems

The website's primary goal is "to present cocoa-related information to the public." Given this informational focus and the heavy use of images and text content, we opted for a predominantly static webpage design approach using HTML and CSS. 
We enhanced this with select interactive components and utilized Bootstrap 5 as our framework for layout structuring and customization. The images were generated using Adobe Firefly and Bing Image Creator.
